# Create Hyper Advanced Processing
    Create Hyper Advanced Processing is a Addon for the Create by Creators-of-Create for Minecraft.
    It plans add many things from Solar Sails to Photon Agitators and have Destroy Integration(maybe)
## What will Create Hyper Advanced Proccessing do?
    Create Hyper Advanced Processing, or CHAP as we call it, is an addon for the Create mod that adds many real world technologies that would be considered "far future" for standard Create such as Wind Tunnels
    *Put wind tunnel image here*
    That act as Modular Multiblock Complexes for create using semi-realistic methods and tools.
## How will Create Hyper Advanced Proccessing do this?
    Currently planned are; 2 Major Multiblocks that do things that can't be done without this old CHAP, multiple Multiblocks for current non-satifactory processes such as Mixing and Pressing, and a multitude on new resources to allow create to bridge the gap from current Create to current addons such as TFMG by DrMango14(insert inline link to https://github.com/DrMango14/Create-The_Factory_Must_Grow), Destroy by PetrolPark(insert inline link to ), and Create Nuclear by Create-Nuclear-Team(insert inline link to https://github.com/valentinlamine/CreateNuclearFabric)
